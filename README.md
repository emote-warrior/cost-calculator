# Commuting Cost Calculator

## About the Project
The Commuting Cost Calculator is a web-based tool designed to help individuals and surveyors calculate the total commuting cost based on various inputs like vehicle type, fuel type, mileage, and parking costs. This tool is especially useful for assessing the impact of commuting costs on decisions to switch to less polluting vehicles or public transportation, particularly in the context of Low Emission Zones (LEZ).

## Features
- **Fuel Type Selection**: Users can select between diesel, petrol, and electric to match their vehicle's fuel type.
- **Dynamic Input Fields**: Depending on the selected fuel type, the calculator dynamically adjusts to request relevant input data.
- **Cost Calculation**: The tool calculates the total commuting cost, including fuel or charging costs and parking fees.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Designed to be used on-the-go, perfect for surveyors conducting field interviews.

## How to Use
1. **Select the Fuel Type**: Choose your vehicle's fuel type from the dropdown menu.
2. **Enter Vehicle Details**:
   - For ICE vehicles (diesel, petrol), input your vehicle's mileage and journey distance.
   - For electric vehicles, input the battery capacity, vehicle range, and journey distance.
3. **Input Parking Costs**: Enter the cost of parking during your commute.
4. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to see the total commuting cost and fuel/charging cost.
5. **Record the Data**: Use the calculated data for further analysis or input into survey forms.
